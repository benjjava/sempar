# sem-biaffine-graph-parser

Implementation of a biaffine parser for producing frame semantic graphs with stack-propagation in the training.

Based on Marie Candito's code for the paper ["Auxiliary Tasks to Boost Biaffine Semantic Dependency Parsing"](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.190/) to appear in Findings of ACL 2022. Marie Candito

Wich is a re-implementation of the biaffine parser for producing dependency graphs [(Dozat et al., 2018)](https://aclanthology.org/P18-2077/), with additional auxiliary tasks.
